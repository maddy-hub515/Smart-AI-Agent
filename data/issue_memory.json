    "issue": "Why is the API returning 401 Unauthorized even though I provided a token?",
    "solution": "From the provided context, it appears that the API is designed to process an address and match it against entries in a PostTown reference table using certain steps. The token-based authorization doesn't seem to be directly involved in this process.\n\nThe issue you are experiencing (401 Unauthorized) might not be related to the cleansing and token split logic, but rather with the authentication mechanism. Here are a few possible reasons for the 401 response:\n\n1. Incorrect or expired access token: Ensure that the provided token is valid and has the necessary permissions to access the API endpoint you are trying to reach. If the token is expired, you'll need to refresh it before making subsequent requests.\n\n2. Incorrect header format: The API might be expecting a specific header format for authentication. For example, you should use 'Authorization: Bearer <access_token>' in your HTTP request headers.\n\n3. Misconfiguration of the API or server: There could be an issue with the API's configuration that prevents it from properly validating tokens.\n\n4. Incorrect endpoint or resource being accessed: If you are trying to access a protected resource that requires authentication, and the endpoint URL is incorrect or inaccessible, the API will return a 401 error.\n\n5. Middleware or global filters: Check if there's any middleware or global filter on your server that may be causing an authorization issue. These components can check for valid tokens, modify requests, or even deny access to certain resources based on user roles or permissions.\n\nTo diagnose the problem further, you can:\n\n- Inspect the HTTP request and response headers and body to see if there's any additional information about the error.\n- Enable detailed logging in your application to help identify the root cause of the issue.\n- Test the API using tools like Postman or curl to confirm that the token is being passed correctly and the endpoint is functioning as expected.\n- Verify that you have the correct permissions for the requested resource, including any required roles or scopes.",

    "solution": "Based on the provided context, it appears that the stored procedure [usp_AddressSearch] expects three main inputs: the full address string, the postcode, and a delimiter for splitting the address components. When you executed `exec usp_AddressSearch '3, Wellow Way Scallows Lane,West Wellow,Romsey SO51 6DX','SO51 6DX',','`, it seems that the issue might be due to the absence of the third parameter (delimiter).\n\nIn this case, the stored procedure is trying to split the address string using the default delimiter (a comma), which does not appear to be appropriate for the provided address. Since the correct delimiter might not be present in the address string, the splitting operation fails and thus, no results are returned.\n\nTo resolve this issue, you can either provide a proper delimiter if one exists in your address string or modify the stored procedure to handle multiple delimiters or missing delimiters more effectively.\n\nIf the provided context does not contain any relevant information, it would be \"No matching logic found in context.\"",
